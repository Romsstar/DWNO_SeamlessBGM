# DWNO Seamless BGM Mod
With this mod the BGM will continue playing seamlessly between maps that use the same BGM.
In addition there is a config option which can disable the Chase BGM but will retain the Chase sound so you can notice being chased.
Special thanks to poyoyuoh for helping with this mod.
